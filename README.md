# dimred
This repo contains slides and a Jupyter notebook about dimensionality reduction techniques. The required dependencies are in `env.yml`. If you're using conda, you can set up a conda environment with all dependencies using:

```
conda env create -f env.yml
```

If you're interested in learning more, one resource I particularly like is this interactive article on t-SNE: [https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/)
